1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Unknown: My name is laner Asha,
I've been working in open source

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,280
for quite some time now I'm
currently employed by the

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,100
hospice Medical Center and the
advanced folks who can greater.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,340
And I'm here to tell you a
little bit about open source in

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,350
research. So first, what is free
and open source software, the

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,920
term is a bit important. Because
open source software and free

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,070
software are not necessarily the
same things free software

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,360
doesn't mean open. So you can
many of us remember free were on

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,090
the internet from when we were
younger. This is software where

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,520
you have no access to source
code and you can't work with it,

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,300
you can't modify it due to
license. This is not great for

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,380
science. On the other hand, open
source doesn't mean free. So for

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,990
those of you who are producing
research software, just because

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,600
you're making your software open
source, it doesn't mean it has

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,400
to be free software. And this
together, the intersection of

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,490
these two is often known as free
and open source software, or

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,570
floss free slash library, open
source software. And this just

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,040
refers to off software there's
both open and free. Open source

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,950
is simply licensing your work so
it can be used how you want.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,000
Making your software, open
source is just a matter of

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,780
setting out the terms of how you
want your software to be used,

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,600
it doesn't mean that you have to
give up control of your

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,760
software, it doesn't mean that
you're putting it out to the

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,240
community forever. It just means
you're choosing and saying for

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,970
yourself setting boundaries on
how you want your software to be

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,140
used. So it's very important
step all the time. For those who

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,100
want you open source also makes
it easy for others to remix your

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,400
software to reuse it to build
upon your software, add new

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,540
features if they want. And if
you're building a project where

30
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,630
community is important, where
you want your software to be

31
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,360
used by a lot of people, making
it open source in such a way

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,630
that people can reuse and work
with you can be a really great

33
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,720
boost for your software just in
terms of visibility and people

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,130
who want to use it, things like
that. So why use and promote

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,030
open source. Open source is part
of the ethics of scientists and

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,370
hackers a little bit when you're
writing the software when you're

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,410
working on projects together. A
lot of the libraries you use for

38
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,750
Python, things like this, if
you're using different

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,390
programming languages, a lot of
Python libraries you use will be

40
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,660
open source, you're benefiting
from a lot of work that other

41
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,400
people have done so far. And
it's a nice feeling to

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,330
collaborate and give back. Now
you've built your software or

43
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,160
your project on years and years
of free work that was produced

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,820
before and now you're giving
back to the community. It also

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,560
means distributed innovation. So
when you're making software open

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,530
source and free so that other
people can work on it. This

47
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,350
means that other people will
give back contributions, they'll

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,020
report bugs, when they have
issues running your software,

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,230
they will tell you new features
that they want. You don't have

50
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,500
to implement them. But you're
able to take all of these good

51
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,010
ideas from the community and
things like this. Importantly,

52
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,160
for science, open source is
easier to review, reuse and

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,810
integrate. And when we talk
about open source in science, if

54
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,540
you want your software to be
distributed widely to be used in

55
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,960
a lot of systems, one of the
best things you can do for it is

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,140
licensing it in such a way that
everyone can use it and set it

57
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,350
up on their own system. Things
like Aleksey so I'm of course

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,190
very biased here, and we'll talk
a lot about galaxy. But in the

59
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,480
galaxy community, we can give a
huge platform of you know,

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,620
unused galaxy, you 30,000 users
to free source, it's free

61
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,890
advertising. But we can only do
that for open source software.

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,970
There are a lot of risks
associated with closed code to

63
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,480
when you have closed source
software that's used in science,

64
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,020
you can't review it very easily,
the community can't review it

65
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,890
very easily only the reviewers
of the paper sometimes. And if

66
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,870
there are errors in the
software, if there are bugs,

67
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,310
then these can be missed for
years and years. And these

68
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,780
effects a lot of scientific
results downstream. So having

69
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,690
open source reviewable software,
it's very important for

70
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,280
reproducible, good quality
science. A lot of the journals

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,960
are adopting this and starting
to require disclosure or

72
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,760
publishing have your source code
for all of your software to this

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,190
is from a scientific
perspective, really a good thing

74
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,070
for the community. So how do you
know if something is open

75
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,070
source? You'll see on a lot of
GitHub repositories, which I

76
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,850
think everyone here is familiar
with, thanks to LS is a little

77
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,470
license icon on the right hand
side of the repository. Also on

78
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,310
things like slides, so you can
see the CC by of these, this

79
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,160
slide deck at the top, you can
look for a couple of different

80
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,760
files within the license. And
these files need to be there if

81
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,910
it's going to be open source
software that she can reuse. But

82
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,220
it's not just for software. I
know I talk a lot about software

83
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,340
but it's also for data. There
are different licenses for data

84
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,730
for things like databases that
you want to make accessible for

85
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,320
photos or training materials,
things like this. All these are

86
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,110
options. And if you want people
to be able to use them, you need

87
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,530
to license

88
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,839
them. One of common fears I hear
about a lot is, if I published

89
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,409
my software online, if I do it
in the open, it'll be I'll be

90
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,289
scooped someone will take my
software and claimants thrown.

91
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,369
But this isn't necessarily true.
If someone steals your software,

92
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:24,509
there is at least a traceable
log in GitHub, or which we'll

93
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,679
get to in a minute. There is a
copy of your software already

94
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:31,529
online. And if you already have
a community around that, it'll

95
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,229
be very obvious that someone
took it. And if you're still

96
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,449
worried, I've heard some people
saying that they publish

97
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:40,259
preprints as a way to document
that, hey, they were first write

98
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,499
the software, and to really make
sure they stake their claim on

99
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:48,089
that software. So don't worry
about that just work in the

100
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:50,399
open, it's better for the
community, it's better for the

101
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,159
world. And it's good for
science, publishing, sharing

102
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,069
open source code. One of the
easiest and most effective ways

103
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,369
to do this is version control.
I'm sure you're all learning

104
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:02,789
about getting GitHub if you
haven't already. But version

105
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,579
control is fantastic way to
publish and share code with

106
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,579
others. It gives you a whole
timeline of your software, and

107
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,899
it makes it easy to reuse,
contribute and make

108
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,919
modifications to your software.
So why collaborating is easy.

109
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:21,119
One of the common things is
reverting accidents. If you make

110
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,489
some bad changes in your code,
or one of your collaborators

111
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:26,099
does, you can always revert you
can always go back to before

112
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,189
then it makes it easy to
integrate the changes from

113
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,089
multiple developers. Like with
galaxy, there are some 200

114
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,209
contributors to the code base or
the training materials as well.

115
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,959
And all of us can work together
collaboratively because we use

116
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,769
version control. Also offsite
copies of your software,

117
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,089
everyone has computer issues,
everyone loses a hard drive at

118
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:52,319
some point or gets their
harddrive encrypted by some

119
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,949
hackers things like this. If you
have all of your work in the

120
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,979
open in public, then you can
just download a new copy again

121
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,049
and start working in Git and
GitHub are very common, a very

122
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,199
common choice. Git is one of the
most common version control

123
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,559
systems, there are others.
GitHub, likewise, is one of the

124
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:15,389
most common good hosts. But
there are others depends on what

125
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,509
you want to use. One of the nice
things you get with GitHub is a

126
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,599
large existing user base and
large community of people who

127
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,659
will be able to contribute to
your software to low barrier for

128
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:29,279
entry. If you need to learn more
about git, there is a great set

129
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,129
of lessons from software
carpentries. But one of the

130
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,729
important notes is that Git is
very, very complex. My partner

131
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:42,239
teaches a get together session
where they teach how to use Git

132
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:45,809
to the colleagues in our office.
And there is just so much to

133
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:48,479
learn about git, but you don't
need to learn all of it. Now.

134
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,479
Just start with the important
parts, the rest comes later.

135
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,299
There, you'll see a lot of
guides online that will say oh,

136
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,789
you need to learn about how the
commit craft works and things

137
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,119
like this. But if you just want
to publish your code, you don't

138
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:03,719
need any of the fancy stuff. So
a few steps to make your work

139
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:08,249
open source. It README is a very
important part of us. If you

140
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:11,429
want people to know what your
software is and how to start

141
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:15,329
using it. That's the number one
thing people will see. So be

142
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,599
sure to include lots of good
images there. License, if it

143
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,239
has, if it's going to be open
source, it needs a license file.

144
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:24,599
So it takes two minutes
satellite essence with GitHub,

145
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,009
it's really easy just doing same
thing tributing guide, GitHub

146
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,829
has some template contributing
guides that make it really easy

147
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,969
to tell people how you want them
to contribute to your to your

148
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,039
repositories. Having a public
roadmap, we aim to talk about

149
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,459
the Kanban boards and the agile.
Having a public roadmap is a

150
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,369
great way to tell community,
what you're working on what

151
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:49,949
features you're going to
implement things like that, that

152
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:54,299
can help people get excited for
your software. Publishing list

153
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,959
of issues same, it feels bad to
say, hey, my software has bugs.

154
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,899
But at least putting them out in
the open, you can track the

155
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,049
things you've done or not done.
A Code of Conduct assumptions

156
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,169
you've learned from MLS is very
important thing. Contact and

157
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,809
citation can be very useful as
well. If you have a GitHub

158
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:14,069
repository, you can easily get
those from Sunoco and figshare.

159
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,429
If you need to do I, there's a
nice website for how to choose a

160
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:22,169
license. There are lots of
different license choices. And

161
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:25,109
they give you a lot of different
freedom to choose what you want

162
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:28,079
your software to be able to do
or what you want other people to

163
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,869
be able to do with your
software. Some people don't want

164
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:34,589
businesses to use their software
for free. And there are licenses

165
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:37,289
that support this or some people
want everyone to use it for

166
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:40,949
free. Lots of different choices.
But the ultimate goal, of

167
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,589
course, is full reproducibility.
And we're getting a lot closer

168
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:46,169
with things like Jupiter and
binder where you can publish

169
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,479
your software but also a
notebook where people can run

170
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:51,389
your software online, which is a
fantastic way to get people to

171
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:52,259
use your software.

172
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,400
Taking it further. There's a lot
of ways for you to contribute if

173
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,000
you're a first time contributor
and to get involved in the open

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,090
Source Software movement and
contributing to the open source

175
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,970
communities. So there are lots
of nice links here if you want

176
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,090
to explore them. And lastly is
the Turing way has a nice

177
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,690
handbook on reproducible data
science and making software open

178
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,260
source and publishing and making
accessible to people. So with

179
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,070
that, thank you
