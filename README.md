## OLS-3 Cohort Talks and Transcripts ðŸ’¬ 

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]


This repository aims to make the Open Life Science (OLS-3) videos and captions accessible, re-useable, and encourage further translation in other languages beyond English and Arabic. All original videos are available in [Open LifeSci YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs12-ZgnDJOWIWN3Vo1XHXA). This project was initiated by [Talarify](https://twitter.com/talarify?lang=en) and [Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia](https://twitter.com/OpenSciSaudi) to facilitate learning of Open science practices to novice learners.

### The table below show the list of the talks and their speakers:
